# Mithril Redux
This package provides utilites for working with Redux within a Mithril application. Similar to `react-redux`.

It doesn't alter the redrawing functionality of Mithril, other than providing some basic middleware below. It does not subscribe to the Redux `store`. It generally allows you to continue to work with Mithril as normal, except with replacing your models with the `store`.

## API

### `Provider.init(store, mithril, component)`

When you are mounting your app, you should call this function to initialize the link between your store and Mithril.

The parameters are the Redux store, then the mithril (`m`) object, and then an optional mithril component. If the component is a function is it instantiated and returned, otherwise it is returned as-is.

#### Example

```js
import m from 'mithril';
import {Provider} from 'mithril-redux';
import configStore from './store';
import Root from './root';

const store = configStore({name: 'World', age: 30});

m.mount(document.body, Provider.init(store, m, Root));
```

### `connect(selector, actions)(component)`

Used to turn your Mithril components into Redux-aware Mithril components. Works similar to `connect` from `react-redux`.

* `selector` - A function which maps the full state to the parts needed.
* `actions` - An object listing action creators to be injected into the controller. Or, a function which returns the said object map.
* `component` - The Mithril component to connect.

#### Example

```js
import {connect} from 'mithril-redux';
import {incrementAge, decrementAge, resetAge} from './actions';

class _AgeBox {
  view(ctrl, {age}) {
    return m('div', [
        m('span', 'Age: ' + age),
        m('button', {onclick: ctrl.dec()}, 'Younger'),
        m('button', {onclick: ctrl.inc()}, 'Older'),
        m('button', {onclick: ctrl.reset()}, 'Reset')
    ]);
  }
}

export const AgeBox = connect((state) => ({age: state.age}), {
  inc: incrementAge,
  dec: decrementAge,
  reset: resetAge
})(_AgeBox);
```

It is worth noting that the action creators exposed on the controller are actually action creator factories. Any parameters you pass in during view creation will be prepended to those passed when the action creator is eventually invoked.

For example, in the code above, if you had `ctrl.reset('Hello')`, then the `resetAge` action creator would be called with `'Hello'` as the first param and the event object as the second.

Also, the `store`'s `dispatch` function is also passed to the props of the view in case necessary.

### `redrawMiddleware`

Adds the ability for actions to specify that they need to cause a redraw. Useful for anything async where Mithril doesn't naturally redraw. This library does not subscribe to the `store`.

Trigger it by setting the `redraw` property on the action to `true`;

#### Example (Setup)

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { redrawMiddleware } from 'mithril-redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

export default function configureStore(initialState) {
  const createModifiedStore = applyMiddleware(
    redrawMiddleware
  )(createStore);
  return createModifiedStore(rootReducer, initialState);
```
